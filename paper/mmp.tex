For each language predicate $p$, a classifier $G_p$ was learned to decide whether objects possessed the attribute denoted by $p$.
This classifier was informed by context sub-classifiers that determined whether $p$ held for subsets of an object's features.

The feature space of objects was partitioned by context, as discussed in Section~\ref{ssec:contexts}.
Each context classifier $M_{c}, c\in\mathcal{C}$ was a quadratic-kernel SVM trained with positive- and negative-labels for context feature vectors derived from the \ispy game (Section~\ref{ssec:gll}).
We defined $M_{c}(\mathcal{X}_i^c)\in [-1,1]$ as the average classifier output over all observations for object $i\in\mathcal{O}$ (individual SVM decisions on observations were in $\{-1,1\}$).

Following previous work in multi-modal exploration~\cite{sinapov:icra14}, for each context we calculated Cohen's Kappa $\kappa_{c}\in[0,1]$ to measure the agreement across observations between the decisions of the $M_{c}$ classifier and the ground truth labels from the \ispy game\footnote{We use $\kappa$ instead of accuracy because it better handles skewed-class data than accuracy, which could be deceptively high for a classifier that always returns false for a low-frequency predicate. We round negative $\kappa$ up to $0$.}.
Given these context classifiers and associated $\kappa$ confidences, we calculate an overall decision, $G_p(i)$, for $i\in\mathcal{O}$ for each behavior $b$ and modality $m$ as:
\begin{equation}
	G_p(i) = \sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}{\kappa_{c} M_{c}(\mathcal{X}_i^c)} \in [-1,1]
\end{equation}
The sign of $G_p(i)$ gives a decision on whether $p$ applies to $i$ with confidence $|G_p(i)|$.

For example, the final classifier built for `fat'$\in P$ gives $G_{\texttt{fat}}(\texttt{wide-yellow-cylinder}) = 0.137$, a positive classification, with $\kappa_{gr,au}=0.515$ for the \textit{gr}asp behavior's \textit{au}ditory modality, the most confident context. This context may be useful for this predicate because the sound of the fingers' motors would stop sooner for wider objects.
