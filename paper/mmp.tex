For each language predicate $p$, a classifier $D_p$ was constructed to decide whether objects possessed the attribute denoted by $p$.
This classifier was informed by sub-classifiers that determined whether $p$ held for a particular subset of the features describing objects.

The feature space of objects was divided up according to the robot behavior, $b\in B$, used to gather the data for those features, as well as the modality, $m\in M$, to which that data belonged.
A behavior together with a modality describe a \textit{context}.
Table~\ref{tab:feature_space_of_contexts} gives the behaviors, modalities, and the number of features assiated with each context.
Each context classifier $C_{bm}$ was a quadratic kernel SVM trained with the positive- and negative-labelled context feature vectors with labels derived from the \ispy game (section~\ref{ssec:gll}).
Given an object $o\in O$ the set of objects, the features relevant for context classifier $C_{bm}$ are denoted $o_{bm}$.
For each object there were a number of \textit{observations} per behavior.
For example, there were 6 angles of images used to compute features in the \textbf{look} behavior, and the robot repeated other behaviors like \textbf{drop} 6 times to gather data.
Then $C_{bm}(o_{bm})\in [-1,1]$, the average over all observations for $o$ where individual SVM decisions on observations were in $\{-1,1\}$.
We calculated the associated Cohen's Kappa $\kappa_{bm}$ of each classifier as the ground truth labels from the \ispy game agreement with the decisions of $C_{bm}$ (at the observation level) to determine a confidence in $[0,1]$.
We ceiling negative $\kappa$ to $0$.

Given these context classifiers and confidences, we calculate $D_p(o)$ for $o\in O$ for each behavior $b$ and modality $m$ as
\begin{equation}
	D_p(o) = \sum_{b\in B,m\in M}{\kappa_{bm} C_{bm}(o_{bm})} \in [-1,1]
\end{equation}
The sign of $D_p(o)$ gives a decision on whether $p$ applies to $o$ with confidence $|D_p(o)|$.
