Grounded language learning bridges human language words like `red' and `square' with robot perception.
The vast majority of existing work in this space limits robot perception to vision.
In this paper, we build perceptual models that use haptic, auditory, and proprioceptive data acquired through robot exploratory behaviors that go beyond vision alone.
Our system learns to ground natural language predicates about objects using supervision from an interactive human-robot \ispy game.
In this game, the human and robot take turns describing an object on a table, then trying to guess which object the other has described.
All supervision labels were gathered from human subjects physically present to play this game with an embodied robot.
We demonstrate that our multi-modal system for grounding natural language outperforms a traditional, vision-only grounding framework by comparing the two on the \ispy task.
We also provide a qualitative analysis of the predicates learned in the game, visualizing what words are learned better with multi-modal sensory information, as well as identifying learned word meanings that correlate with physical object properties (e.g. `empty' negatively correlates with object weight).
