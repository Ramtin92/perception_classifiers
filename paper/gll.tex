Language predicates and positive/negative labels for those predicates were gathered through human-robot dialog during the \ispy game.
The human subject and robot were seated at opposite ends of a small table.
A small set of objects (4 in our experiments) were placed on the table for both to see.
We denote the objects on the table during a given game as set $O_T$.

\paragraph{Human Turn.} On the subject's turn, the robot asked them to pick an object and describe it to them in one phrase.
Following~\cite{parde:ijcai15}, we used a stopword list to strip out non-content words from the subject's description.
The remaining words were treated as a set of language predicates, $H_p$.
To guess which object the subject was describing, the robot assigned scores to each object on the table.
The score $S$ of each object $o\in O_T$ was calculated as
\begin{equation}
	S(o) = \sum_{p\in H_p}{F_p(o)}
\end{equation}
The robot guessed objects in descending order by score (ties broken randomly) by pointing at them and asking whether it was correct.
When the correct object was found, it was added as a positive training example for the classifiers of all $p\in H_p$ used to describe it by the subject for use in future training.

\paragraph{Robot Turn.} On the robot's turn, it chose an object at random from those on the table it hadn't chosen before in this game.
To describe the object, the robot scored the possible predicates that could describe it.
Following Gricean principles~\cite{grice:bkchapter75}, our robot should describe the object with both predicates it believes applies and predicates that do not ambiguously refer to other objects on the table.
With this in mind, we develop a predicate score that rewards describing chosen object $o_c$ and penalized for describing the other objects on the table.
The score $S$ for each predicate $p$ was calculated as
\begin{equation}
	S(p) = |O_T|F_p(o_c) - \sum{o_{d\in{O_T}\setminus\{o_c\}}}{F_p(o_d)}
\end{equation}
Note that this scoring equation also rewards predicates for describing $o_c$ while negatively describing the other objects on the table (\textit{e.g.} $F_p(o_d)<0$).
The robot choose the highest three scoring predicates $\hat{P}$ to describe object $o_c$ to the user.
Once ready to guess, the user touched objects until the robot confirmed to them that they had guessed the right one ($o_c$).

The robot then pointed to $o_c$ and a brief follow-up dialog was used to gather both positive and negative labels for $o_c$.
In addition to predicates $\hat{P}$ used to describe the object, the robot selected two additional predicates $\bar{P}$ for which it was uncertain whether the property applied to $o_c$.
$\bar{P}$ were selected randomly with $p\in P$ having a chance of inclusion proportional to $1-|F_p(o_c)|$, such that classifiers with near-zero confidence in whether $p$ applied to $o_c$ were more likely to be selected.
The robot then asked the subject whether they would describe the object $o_c$ as each of $p\in\hat{P}\cup\bar{P}$.
The subject's response to these questions provided additional positive/negative labels to the classifiers of these predicates for use in future training.
