To play \ispy, we first gathered sensory data from a set of objects to be played with through robot manipulation behaviors (described in Section~\ref{sec:dataset}).
When playing a game, the robot was given unique identifying numbers for each object on the table and could look up relevant feature vectors when performing grounding.

The robot was able to detect human touches on the tops of objects as well as reach out and touch objects itself when guessing.
We implemented robot behaviors in the Robot Operating System (ROS)\footnote{\texttt{http://www.ros.org/}} and performed text-to-speech using the Festival Speech Synthesis System\footnote{\texttt{http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/}}.
