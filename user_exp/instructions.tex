\section{Overview}

\paragraph{} You will play a game similar to I, Spy with the robot. You will go first, describing an object on the table to the robot. The robot will point to objects and ask whether it has selected the right one until it guesses correctly. Then the robot will attempt to describe an object to you, and you will pick up objects to indicate your guess until you select correctly.

\paragraph{} After picking up an object on the table, be sure to place it back down on the `x'-marker from which you took it.

\paragraph{} You'll play two games of I, Spy with the robot. During the intermission between, the experimenter will need to set up a new set of objects. During this time, you may be asked to step out of the room.

\section{Your Turn}

\paragraph{} On your turn, pick an object in your mind. As in I, Spy, you want to describe properties of this object rather than stating exactly what it is (e.g. ``something black and rectangular" as opposed to ``"a whiteboard eraser"). The robot has had the opportunity to explore these objects in serveral ways, such as looking at them, picking them up, and pushing and squeezing them. You should feel free to explore the object you want to describe by picking it up and examining it physically as well as visually before offering your description. Don't worry---the robot won't cheat by remembering which one you were exploring.

\paragraph{} Say your description out loud when you're ready. The robot will make guesses by extending its arm over the object it thinks you described and ask you to confirm or deny whether it guessed correctly. This process will repeat until it guesses correctly.

\section {Robot's Turn}

\paragraph{} On the robot's turn, it will pick an object and try to describe that object to you. Again, you should feel free to explore the objects on the table physically as well as visually to evaluate the properties the robot uses to describe the object.

\paragraph{} When you're ready to make a guess, move your hands away from the objects and say ``okay". This lets the robot know the next object you pick up is your guess. Reach out and pick up the object you think the robot is describing, then put it back down when the robot tells you whether or not this was the correct object. If you're wrong, move your hands away and again say ``okay" before your next guess. You can inspect the objects again before you're ready to guess, if you want.
