-write launchfile that opens classifier services with arguments to source and classifier dirs, sound play, and speech recognition
-add debug information to python_classifier_services node so it doesn't sit all creepy
-will have to write translation script to pre-process utterances from google speech since so many words get garbled. this might be easiest to do as a pre-pilot phase
-add classifier runs for object to unit test, e.g. "run classifiers on position [X]" to get all positive results for that object
	-maybe add re-runs too "add object [X] to classifier [Y] as [pos/neg]" to make sure retraining works
-get speech node to not crash every time it hasn't been in use for a few minutes
-add "i didn't catch that" to processing to make conversation turn-taking on failure
