run with

$ rosrun perception_classifiers classifier_services

for mechanical turk interface, also run rosbridge_websocket and ispyServer

there are fairly clear places in IspyAgent.py where pointing / looking for a guess should be added, 
marked with # TODO flags

in classifier_services.cpp there are also // TODO flags for loading features properly in both 
trainClassifier and runClassifier

Quick test of fetch_features:
$ rosrun perception_classifiers fetch_features
$ rosservice call /fetch_feature_service <double tab to complete message header>
