launch with

$ rosrun perception_classifiers classifier_services

the ispy game is sort of shaky right now since i'm 'loading' in a single observation that's a 
vector of length 1 with entry 0.0

there are fairly clear places in IspyAgent.py where pointing / looking for a guess should be added, 
marked with # TODO flags

in classifier_services.cpp there are also // TODO flags for loading features properly in both 
trainClassifier and runClassifier
